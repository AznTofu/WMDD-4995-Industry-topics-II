# What does Made stand for?

Made for Design specializes in Graphic and Web, I provide clean and simple designs that are unique for each client. The name Made for Design was created to represent myself. By taking the first syllables of my last name and first name it creates the identity of my company. Ma Denise, made by me for you.

# What does your logo mean?

The transitioning layers depicted in the logo provide a visual story on my process as a designer. Coming from a Fine Arts background, I enjoy expressing my creativity through crafting with physical materials, this is where I get a lot of my design ideas. From that I progressed into using software, digitizing these concepts into high fidelity prototypes, interface designs, layouts etc. The third layer is an opening and closing tag used in code, representing my ability to do front end development.


# Where do you get your design inspirations?

I feel that effective design is when information is made meaningful and concise by giving it shape. My designs lean toward a minimal aesthetic, however as a designer I constantly update myself on trends and new styles. I mostly find design inspirations from artworks and art movements. An example would be this Logo of an orange I designed for a Meal planning app “Peal”. It fashions some elements from the pop art movement, harsh lines and vivid colour.

# What projects have you worked on?

Majority of the projects that I have worked on were digital. Apart from website layouts and UI designs, I worked on individual Design components, some of these consist projects such as brand logos, icons, promotional banners, call to action buttons, online magazine layouts, posters etc.
