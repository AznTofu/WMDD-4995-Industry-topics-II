In this post I will demonstrate my creative and technological process for building the graphic representation for Made for Design. The end result was more skeumorphic which made a good subject for a tutorial, but not a logo. So I further simplified it into a flat design to create the current logo.


# Conceptualization

The first step was to conceptualize how I wanted to be represented as a designer. This was probably the most difficult step because it meant that I had to break myself down into marketable elements. So I started with a mind map:

After creating the mind map and picking the words I found most relevant, I started to sketch out ideas for the logo. In one of the iterations I broke down my last name as a chinese character and started playing with the shapes to create a customized signature. In the end I decided to go with the more geometrical and symbolic approach.

# Execution of design in Adobe Illustrator

## Creating Guides

With the final design in mind I created a 6 sided polygon using the shape tool. The objective was to create a guide for the design so that it would be symmetrical and geometrically sound. I then copied the polygon using the Alt/Option key whilst dragging the shape upwards to create the silhouette that I desired.

After the silhouette was done, using the line tool and pressing the SHIFT key I created lines to connect the points, creating cross sections, intersections and parallel lines for the shapes to sit on. To make them into guides I selected the entire shape went to the tool bar clicked *View > Guides > Make Guides*, or *Command/Control 5* as a shortcut.

## First Graphic Block: Texture

Once the guides were made I created a few squares to hold some of the colours from the colour swatch I had made for this website. Then using the shape tool again I created two rectangles and a square. To get it to fit the shape of the guides I used the direct selection tool and matched the points on the guide I had created. This layer will contain some wood textures which I will now explain step by step.

First I create a square 400 x 400 pixels using this shape tool and fill it with brown for the base colour of the wood. To create a texture to imitate wood grains I created a small black rectangle 200 x 20 pixels and changed its opacity to 40%. Going to the tool bar I selected Effect > Sketch > Graphic Pen.

This will present a pop-up window showing all the properties for the Graphic Pen effect where I specified:

* Stroke Length: 15
* Light/Dark Balance: 3
* Direction: Vertical

In order to manipulate the colour of the grain texture I would need to change this image into paths by selecting Window > Image Trace and changed the Image trace properties as such:

* Paths: 50%
* Corners: 75%
* Noise: 25px
* Create Fills
* Ignore White

And then increased the size of the grain path to 400 x 400 pixels to match its base. To create multiple layers I copied the texture and alternate it with a darker brown to create more depth. To use this texture in multiple shapes I made it into a pattern by selecting Object > Pattern > Make. Which would store this pattern into the pattern swatches folder in illustrator for later use.

After using the pattern on the shapes I had built, copied one side of the cube and used the gradient tool, changing the blending option to Multiply to get a translucent gradient. By doing so I have created shadow for the block, thus making it seem more three dimensional.

## Second Block: Opacity

The second block is basically a play on transparency. Using the previous block I copied its individual panels by pressing the Option key whilst dragging and filled it with the blue from the colour swatch. Making the left side of the block fill 70% opacity and the right side and top of the block fill 50% opacity. Then again to create a more 3 dimensional effect I duplicated the right and top panel, using the gradient tool in blue + white instead of black + white and changed its blending options to Multiply.

## Third Block: Alignment

In the last layer I wanted to depict the transition into flat pixels. Using the rounded square shape tool, I created long shapes in various lengths and colours and aligned them to the guides using the align tool.

And this is the finished product.
